# LD35_WhoLetTheChicksOut

C#/Unity Engine - #LDJAM35 compo code. This code is part of a game that was created in two days. All art, music, and programming were created by me in that time period. I allocated the largest portion of time to the art and the smallest portion to music. My coding time was kept to a minimum, as well, because I am not particularly skilled in the art department.

You can try the game here if I'm still hosting it: http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/jdmazz/.
